As an international student, I find the dataset, Students: Germany, semester, nationality, sex, subject 
(https://www-genesis.destatis.de/genesis//online?operation=table&code=21311-0003&bypass=true&levelindex=1&levelid=1714001036017#abreadcrumb) 
interesting because it provides insights into the popularity and gender distribution among German and foreign students in various fields of study.

Possible questions to answer with these data:

1. What are the trends in student enrollment across various fields of study?

2. Show the distribution of students across top 10 subjects.

3. How does gender distribution vary across different fields of study?

4. Which subject is most popular among international students?

5. Which subjects are most popular among male versus female students?

6. Can we predict future enrollments based on previous semester data?


First, weâ€™ll need to these python libraries to answer these questions:
- pandas 
- numpy 
- matplotlib
- seaborn 
- sklearn

1. Trends in student enrollment across various fields of study could be answered by creating 
    a line plot with semesters on the x-axis and the total number of students on the y-axis. 
    Each line, colored differently, will represent a unique subject. 
    For data manipulation and visualization numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn could be used.
    This plot will show how the student enrollment in each subject has changed over the semesters.

2. Gender distribution across different fields of study could be answered with a stacked bar chart 
    with subjects on the x-axis and the total number of students on the y-axis. 
    Each bar will be divided into two sections (stacked), one for male students and one for female students. 
    This chart can be generated using matplotlib or seaborn. 
    For data grouping we will need pandas `groupby()` function.

3. Most popular subject among international students could be answered by finding the subject 
    that has the highest count of foreign students using pandas `value_counts()` function.

4. Most popular subjects among male versus female students could be answered by finding the subject 
    that has the highest count of male students and the subject that has the highest count of female students.
    It will also use the `value_counts()` function.

5. Predicting future enrollments based on previous semester data could be answered using 
    a linear regression model to predict future enrollments. 
    The model will be trained with semesters as the independent variable and the total number of students as the dependent variable. 
    Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the total number of students for the next semester.
    It will the `LinearRegression()` function from sklearn for linear regression modeling.
