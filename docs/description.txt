As an international student, I find the dataset, Students: Germany, semester, nationality, sex, subject 
(https://www-genesis.destatis.de/genesis//online?operation=table&code=21311-0003&bypass=true&levelindex=1&levelid=1714001036017#abreadcrumb) 
interesting because it provides insights into the popularity and gender distribution among German and foreign students in various fields of study.

Possible questions to answer with these data:

1. What are the trends in student enrollment across various fields of study?

2. How does gender distribution vary across different fields of study?

3. Which subject is most popular among international students?

4. Which subjects are most popular among male versus female students?

5. Can we predict future enrollments based on previous semester data?
