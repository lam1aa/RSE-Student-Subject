## Project Overview ##

This project is a comprehensive analysis of educational trends in Germany, with a focus on higher education. Utilizing advanced data analysis and visualization techniques, we aim to provide valuable insights that can inform decisions related to higher education policies and practices.

The primary resource for our analysis is the [Students: Germany, semester, nationality, sex, subject](https://www-genesis.destatis.de/genesis//online?operation=table&code=21311-0003&bypass=true&levelindex=1&levelid=1714001036017#abreadcrumb) dataset from the [Genesis Online](https://www-genesis.destatis.de/genesis/online) Database. This dataset offers detailed statistics on student demographics in Germany, including the distribution of gender across various subjects and semesters.

Our goal is to leverage this data to understand patterns and trends in higher education in Germany. By doing so, we hope to contribute to the ongoing discussions and efforts aimed at improving educational outcomes and experiences for all students.
